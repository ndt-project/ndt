#summary Description of the NDT Protocol

= Network Diagnostic Tool Protocol (NDTP) =

== Abstract == 

The Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) is a client/server program that provides network configuration and performance testing to a user's computer. It uses a well-defined protocol to provide a reliable communication link between client and server. This protocol documentation is sufficient to allow outside parties to write compatible NDT clients without consulting the NDT source code. This documentation contains a state transition diagrams detailing the various states that the components (both server and client) can be in, and the valid messages that can or will be transmitted or received in those states.

== Introduction ==

Several studies have shown that the majority of network performance problems occur in or near the users’ desktop/laptop computer.  These problems include, but are not limited to, duplex mismatch conditions on Ethernet/FastEthernet links, incorrectly set TCP buffers in the local network infrastructure (e.g. first hop switch/router, hubs, etc.) and bad or dirty cables. NDT seeks to determine why a network connection exhibits certain performance characteristics. In addition to measuring the familiar upload and download speeds of a user's connection, NDT also performs tests that can assess factors such as latency, packet loss, congestion, bad cables, out of order delivery and bottlenecks on the end-to-end path from client to server (on either side of the connection). 

The NDT popularity has grown in recent years, which led to an increased interest from the developers community around the world. People started to integrate the NDT with their systems using a different approaches, like adding a Web Developer's API to a Web based (java applet) client and writing a new mobile (Android based) client.

The NDTP is allowing outside parties to easily extend both the NDT server and client parts and write compatible clients in new languages that will be able to communicate with the publicly available Measurement Lab servers.

In this document, the key words "MUST", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", and "MAY" are to be interpreted as described in [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt RFC2119].

=== Relationship of Tests and Control Protocols ===

The NDTP actually consists of a two inter-related sets of protocols: NDTP-Control and NDTP-Tests. NDTP-Control is used to initiate, start, and stop test sessions and to fetch their results, whereas NDTP-Tests is a set of smaller sub-protocols concentrated on testing a specific network performance problems.

The NDTP-Tests consists of a five smaller sub-protocols: Middlebox test, Simple firewall test, C2S throughput test, S2C throughput test and META test. These tests are completely independent from each other and can be run in any order. Moreover, a new NDTP-Tests protocols can be easily created and integrated into the existing tests ecosystem.

The NDTP-Control is designed to support the negotiation of test sessions and results retrieval in a straightforward manner. At the session initiation, there is a negotiation of the test suite and the session start time. Moreover, the server version is being verified to discover the possibility of incompatibilities. Additionally, the NDTP-Control defines an exact message format, which greatly increase the general protocol reliability and allows other NDTP-Tests protocols to communicate in a convenient and a more structured fashion.

The NDTP-Control protocol can effectively be used to implement not only a new types of clients, but also can be treated as a generic framework to create and combine with each other a completely new NDTP-Tests protocols.

=== Logical Model ===

Several different roles on both NDTP-Control and NDTP-Tests levels can be distinguished. Specifically, the following ones should be highlighted:

|| *Role* || *Description* ||
|| Session-Sender || The sending endpoint of the NDTP-Tests session. ||
|| Session-Receiver || The receiving endpoint of the NDTP-Tests session. ||
|| Server || An end system that manages the NDTP-Control and NDTP-Tests sessions, performs the specific tests needed to determine what problems, if any, exist. The server process then analyzes the test results and returns these results to the client. ||
|| Client || An end system that initiates requests for the NDTP-Tests sessions, triggers the start of a set of sessions and receives the tests results. ||

Different logical roles can be played by the same host. For example the Server machine is a Session-Sender in the S2C throughput test, while it is a Session-Receiver in the C2S throughput test.

Please look at the figures describing the two main NDTP-Tests protocols:

 * C2S throughput test

 * S2C throughput test

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/2.%20S2C%20throughput%20test.png

== Protocol Overview ==

As described above, the NDTP consists of a two inter-related sets of protocols: NDTP-Control and NDTP-Tests. Both of them are layered over TCP. The former is used to initiate and control the test sessions and to fetch their results. The latter set of protocols is used to perform the specific tests.

The initiator of the test session establishes a TCP connection to a well-known port, 3001, on the target point and this connection remains open for the duration of the NDTP-Tests sessions. The NDT server SHOULD listen to this well-known port.

The NDTP-Control messages are transmitted before the NDTP-Tests sessions are actually started, after they are completed and between particular tests from the performed test suite. Moreover, a specific tests also use the NDTP-Control messages to synchronise the test sessions, exchange a configuration data and additional information.

All multi-octet quantities defined in this document are represented as unsigned integers in a network byte order unless specified otherwise.

== NDTP-Control ==

The type of each NDTP-Control message can be found after reading the first octet. The length of each NDTP-Control message can be computed upon reading its fixed-size part. No message is shorter than 3 octets.

An implementation SHOULD expunge unused state to prevent denial-of-service attacks, or unbounded memory usage, on the server.  For example, if the full control message is not received within some number of seconds after it is expected, the TCP connection associated with the NDTP-Control session SHOULD be dropped. A value of no more than 60 seconds is RECOMMENDED.

=== Message structure ===

Each of the NDTP-Control messages always has the following format:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/3.%20Each%20of%20the%20NDTP-Control%20messages%20always%20has%20the%20following%20format.png

=== Message types ===

The NDTP-Control currently defines the following types of messages:

|| *Symbolic name* || *Bit value* || *Description* ||
|| COMM_FAILURE || 0 || Notification about communication link failure. ||
|| SRV_QUEUE || 1 || Message used to the Clients' queue management ||
|| MSG_LOGIN || 2 || Used during initialization to negotiate the NDT version and the test suite ||
|| TEST_PREPARE || 3 || Used to send all information needed for a particular test (i.e. port numbers, test time, etc.) ||
|| TEST_START || 4 || Message used to start a specific test ||
|| TEST_MSG || 5 || Used during tests to communicate between the Client and the Server ||
|| TEST_FINALIZE || 6 || Message used to end a specific test ||
|| MSG_ERROR || 7 || Used to send an error messages and notifications about invalid states of the test session ||
|| MSG_RESULTS || 8 || Contains a final test sessions' results ||
|| MSG_LOGOUT || 9 || This is the last message send by the Server after MSG_RESULTS messages. The Server SHOULD close the NDTP-Control connection after sending this message. ||
|| MSG_WAITING || 10 || Message from the Client to notify the Server that the Client is still alive ||

=== Protocol description ===

==== Logging in to the server with a test suite request ====

Before the Client can start the test session, it has to establish a connection to the Server.

First, the Client opens a TCP connection to the Server on a well-known port 3001 and sends a LOGIN message:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/4.%20Server%20on%20a%20well-known%20port%203001%20and%20sends%20a%20LOGIN%20message.png

Where TESTS is a bitwise OR of the tests' ids that should be run in a requested test-suite. The Tests' ids are defined in the [NDTProtocol#NDTP-Tests NDTP-Tests] section.

All Clients MUST always request the TEST_STATUS (16 (1L << 4)) test in order to notify the Server that they support the MSG_WAITING messages introduced in the NDT v3.5.5.

==== Kick off message to disconnect old clients ====

In the same time the Server sends the specially crafted 13 octets long data that kicks off the old Clients ("123456 654321" - the old Clients tried to treat these string encoded numbers as the port numbers and failed to do this):

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/5.%2013%20octets%20long%20data%20that%20kicks%20off%20the%20old%20Clients%20%28%22123456%20654321%22%29.png

All non-compatible Clients MUST drop the connection after receiving the above message.

==== Queuing clients ====

Next, the NDT Server MUST send a one or more SRV_QUEUE messages to inform the Client whether or not it needs to wait, or can start performing tests. These messages MUST contain one of the following string values:

|| *SRV_QUEUE value* || *Description* ||
|| "0" || The test session will start now ||
|| "9977" || Server Fault: test session will be terminated for unknown reason. Client MUST drop the connection after receiving this message. ||
|| "9988" || If this is a first message from the Server, then it means that the Server is busy. In other cases it means the Server Fault. the Client MUST drop the connection after receiving this message. ||
|| "9990" || This is a check from the Server to verify if the queued Client is alive. Available from v3.5.5. The Client MUST respond to this message by sending an empty 'MSG_WAITING' message. The Server will only send these messages to the queued Clients that requested TEST_STATUS test. ||
|| "N" || Where N is any other value. It means the estimated number of minutes that the Client will wait for its test to begin. ||

When the NDT Server decides that the Client can start its test session, it sends the SRV_QUEUE message with value *'0'*:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/6.%20sends%20SRV_QUEUE%20message%20with%20value%20%270%27.png

The SRV_QUEUE messages are only sent to the queued Clients.

==== Verifying version compatibility ====

At the beginning of the test session the Server and the Client MUST verify their version compatibility.

The Server MUST send a MSG_LOGIN message containing its version identifier in the following form:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/7.%20MSG_LOGIN%20message%20containing%20its%20version%20identifier%20in%20the%20following%20form.png

where VERSION is the current NDT version encoded as ascii string, for example *"3.6.4"*.

It is RECOMMENDED, that the Client will display a warning message in case of the difference. Moreover, the Client MAY also drop a connection when incompatibility is too big.

==== Negotiating test suite ====

In the next step the NDT Server MUST send a MSG_LOGIN message containing a list of tests' ids, encoded as ascii string, that will be performed. This list of tests's ids MUST NOT contain any tests that were not requested by the Client in the first MSG_LOGIN message. The Server's MSG_LOGIN message looks as following:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/8.%20encoded%20as%20ascii%20string,%20that%20will%20be%20performed.png

This list is a string containing space separated numbers that describes the particular tests. The test suite containing all five tests (Middlebox test, Simple firewall test, C2S throughput test, S2C throughput test and META test) will be encoded in the following message:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/ndt_8b.png

The Client MUST drop the connection when it receives unknown test id, because such situation means an error on the Server's part.

The next step is to run the negotiated test suite. The tests MUST be performed in the order received from the Server. Any specific test related configuration (like port numbers, test duration, etc.) MUST be negotiated by the particular NDTP-Tests sub-protocol.

==== Results retrieval ====

After the last accomplished NDTP-Tests test (the particular NDTP-Tests sub-protocols are described in the [NDTProtocol#NDTP-Tests NDTP-Tests] section) the Server MUST send all gathered results to the Client. These results MUST be sent in a set of MSG_RESULTS messages:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/9.%20These%20results%20MUST%20be%20sent%20in%20a%20set%20of%20MSG_RESULTS%20messages.png

All standard results are currently encoded as strings and MAY be displayed by the Client directly on the screen without any modifications.

At the end the Server MUST close the whole test session by sending an empty MSG_LOGOUT message and closing connection with the Client.

The whole test session overview can be seen on the following sequence diagram. Both the Server and the Client MUST follow the described sequence:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/10.%20Both%20Server%20and%20Client%20MUST%20follow%20the%20described%20sequence.png

== NDTP-Tests ==

The NDTP-Tests currently defines the following types of tests:

|| *Symbolic name* || *Integer value* || *Description* ||
|| TEST_MID || 1 (1L << 0) || Middlebox test - a short (5 seconds) throughput test from the Server to the Client with a limited CWND to check for a duplex mismatch condition. Moreover, it also checks the MSS value and does NAT detection ||
|| TEST_C2S || 2 (1L << 1) || 10 seconds C2S throughput test ||
|| TEST_S2C || 4 (1L << 2) || 10 seconds S2C throughput test ||
|| TEST_SFW || 8 (1L << 3) || Simple firewall test ||
|| TEST_META || 32 (1L << 5) || META test ||

Moreover, the NDT v3.5.5 introduced a new mechanism to avoid zombie Clients (i.e. queued Clients that will never start their test session). In order to enable this mechanism the Client MUST add the following test to its test suite request:

|| *Symbolic name* || *Integer value* || *Description* ||
|| TEST_STATUS || 16 (1L << 4) || A special flag to notify the Server that this Client will respond to status requests ||

All Clients MUST support TEST_STATUS mechanism.

=== Middlebox test ===

The Middlebox test is a short throughput test from the Server to the Client with a limited CWND to check for a duplex mismatch condition. Moreover, this test uses a pre-defined MSS value to check if any intermediate node will modify its connection settings.

==== MID protocol ====

All messages exchanged between the Client and the Server during the MID protocol are sent using the same connection and message format as the NDTP-Control protocol. Only the throughput packets are sent on the new connection and do not follow the NDTP-Control protocol message format.

As a first step the Server MUST bind a new port and send a TEST_PREPARE message containing this port number to the Client:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/18.%20TEST_PREPARE%20message%20containing%20this%20port%20number%20to%20the%20Client.png

The port number must be encoded as string.

Next, the Client MUST connect to this newly bound port and start reading data from the Server.

When the Client successfully connects, the NDT Server MUST start 5 seconds throughput test on the newly created connection.

The NDT Server in the MID Throughput test MUST send packets through the newly opened connection as fast as possible (i.e. without any delays) for 5 seconds. These packets must be written using the buffer of the following size:
{{{
(The current maximum segment size (MSS))
}}}

If for some reasons it is not possible to use such a big buffer, the Server MUST use a 8192 Byte one. The content of the buffer SHOULD be as random as possible (to avoid any automatic compression mechanisms) and MUST include only printable characters. The maximum value of the congestion window during the MID Throughput test MUST be set to the following value:
{{{
2 * (The current maximum segment size (MSS))
}}}

When the test is over, the Server MUST send its results encoded as strings in a TEST_MSG message to the Client. These results MUST contain the following variables:

|| CurMSS || The current maximum segment size (MSS), in octets.||
|| !WinScaleSent || The value of the transmitted window scale option if one was sent; otherwise, a value of -1. ||
|| !WinScaleRcvd || The value of the received window scale option if one was received; otherwise, a value of -1. ||

The above variables can be obtained by using a [http://www.web100.org/ web100] project. All available web100 data variables are described in [NDTProtocol#Appendix_A._web100_variables Appendix A].

The whole TEST_MSG message sent to the Client looks as following:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/12.%20TEST_MSG%20message%20to%20Client.png

Next, the Client MUST send to the Server its calculated throughput value encoded as string (float format) in a TEST_MSG message. The throughput value MUST be calculated using the following formula:
{{{
THROUGHPUT_VALUE = 8 * TRANSMITTED_BYTES / 1000 / TEST_TIME
}}}

At the end the Server MUST close the MID test session by sending an empty TEST_FINALIZE message.

A Middlebox test session overview can be seen on the following sequence diagram:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/13.%20A%20Middlebox%20test%20session%20overview%20can%20be%20seen%20on%20the%20following%20sequence%20diagram.png

=== Simple firewall test ===

The Simple firewall test tries to find out any firewalls between the Client and the Server that will prevent connections to an ephemeral port numbers. The test is performed in both directions (i.e. the Client is trying to connect to the Server (c2s) and the Server is trying to connect to the Client (s2c)).

==== SFW protocol ====

All messages exchanged between the Client and the Server during the SFW protocol are sent using the same connection and message format as the NDTP-Control protocol. Only a single TEST_MSG message containing a pre-defined string "Simple firewall test" are sent using the new connection to check for firewall existence.

As a first step the Server MUST bind the ephemeral port and send a TEST_PREPARE message containing this port number and a test time (in seconds) to the Client using the NDTP-Control connection:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/15.%20TEST_PREPARE%20message%20containing%20this%20port%20number%20and%20test%20time%20%28in%20seconds%29%20to%20the%20Client.png

The port number and the test time MUST be encoded as strings and separated by a single space. For example the whole message will look as following:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/ndt_15b.png

Next, the Client MUST bind the ephemeral port and send a TEST_MSG message containing only this port number to the Server using the NDTP-Control connection. The port number MUST be encoded as string.

The NDT Server MUST start the test by sending an empty TEST_START message (using the NDTP-Control connection) immediately after it receives the Client's ephemeral port number.

The test MUST be performed in both directions in parallel. The Client MUST try to connect to the Server's ephemeral port and MUST send a TEST_MSG message containing a pre-defined string "Simple firewall test" of length 20 using the newly created connection. The whole message looks as following:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/14.%20of%20length%2020.%20The%20whole%20message%20looks%20as%20following.png

After performing the Simple firewall test in both directions, the Server MUST send to the Client its SFW (c2s) results encoded as string in the TEST_MSG message using the NDTP-Control connection:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/16.%20Client%20its%20SFW%20%28c2s%29%20results%20encoded%20as%20string%20in%20the%20TEST_MSG%20message.png

The Simple firewall test defines the following result codes for both c2s and s2c tests:

|| *Value* || *Description* ||
|| "0" || Test was not started ||
|| "1" || Test was successful (i.e. connection to the ephemeral port was possible) ||
|| "2" || There was a connection to the ephemeral port, but it was not recognized properly ||
|| "3" || There was no connection to the ephemeral port within the specified time ||

At the end the Server MUST close the SFW test session by sending an empty TEST_FINALIZE message using the NDTP-Control connection.

A Simple firewall test session overview can be seen on the following sequence diagram:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/17.%20A%20Simple%20firewall%20test%20session%20overview%20can%20be%20seen%20on%20the%20following%20sequence%20diagram.png

=== C2S throughput test ===

The C2S throughput test tests the achievable network bandwidth from the client to the server by performing a 10 seconds memory-to-memory data transfer.

==== C2S protocol ====

All messages exchanged between the Client and the Server during the C2S protocol are sent using the same connection and message format as the NDTP-Control protocol. Only the throughput packets are sent on the new connection and do not follow the NDTP-Control protocol message format.

As a first step the Server MUST bind the new port and send a TEST_PREPARE message containing this port number to the Client:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/18.%20TEST_PREPARE%20message%20containing%20this%20port%20number%20to%20the%20Client.png

The port number must be encoded as string.

Next, the Client MUST connect to this newly bound port.

In order to start the test, the Server MUST send an empty TEST_START message.

The Client MUST start 10 seconds throughput test and the Server MUST read transmitted data.

The NDT Client in the C2S Throughput test MUST use a 8192 Byte buffer to send the packets through the newly opened connection as fast as possible (i.e. without any delays) for 10 seconds. The content of the buffer SHOULD be as random as possible (to avoid any automatic compression mechanisms) and MUST include only printable characters.

When the Client stops streaming the test data (or the test routine at the Server times out after 11 seconds from the last TEST_START message), the Server MUST send to the Client its calculated throughput value encoded as string (float format) in the TEST_MSG message. The throughput value MUST be calculated using the following formula:
{{{
THROUGHPUT_VALUE = 8 * TRANSMITTED_BYTES / 1000 / TEST_TIME
}}}

The Server's TEST_MSG message looks as following: 

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/20.%20Client%20its%20calculated%20throughput%20value%20encoded%20as%20string%20%28float%20format%29%20in%20the%20TEST_MSG%20message.png

At the end the Server MUST close the C2S test session by sending an empty TEST_FINALIZE message.

A C2S throughput test session overview can be seen on the following sequence diagram:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/21.%20A%20C2S%20throughput%20test%20session%20overview%20can%20be%20seen%20on%20the%20following%20sequence%20diagram.png

=== S2C throughput test ===

The S2C throughput test tests the achievable network bandwidth from the Server to the Client by performing a 10 seconds memory-to-memory data transfer.

The NDT Server uses a [http://www.web100.org/ web100] project to perform a detailed connection measurements. This means that the Server is also collecting the web100 data variables, that MUST be send to the Client at the end of the whole test session. All available web100 data variables are described in [NDTProtocol#Appendix_A._web100_variables Appendix A].

==== S2C protocol ====

All messages exchanged between the Client and the Server during the S2C protocol are sent using the same connection and message format as the NDTP-Control protocol. Only the throughput packets are sent on the new connection and do not follow the NDTP-Control protocol message format.

As a first step the Server MUST bind the new port. Next, it MUST send a TEST_PREPARE message containing this port number to the Client using the NDTP-Control connection:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/22.%20TEST_PREPARE%20message%20containing%20this%20port%20number%20to%20the%20Client.png

The port number must be encoded as string.

Next, the Client MUST connect to this newly bound port.

In order to start the test, the Server MUST send an empty TEST_START message.

The Server MUST start 10 seconds throughput test and the Client MUST read the transmitted data.

The NDT Server in the S2C Throughput test MUST use a 8192 Byte buffer to send the packets through the newly opened connection as fast as possible (i.e. without any delays) for 10 seconds. The content of the buffer SHOULD be as random as possible (to avoid any automatic compression mechanisms) and MUST include only printable characters.

When the Server stops streaming the test data, it MUST send to the Client its calculated throughput value (encoded as string in float format), amount of unsent data in the socket send queue (encoded as string in integer format) and overall number of sent bytes (encoded as string in float format) in the TEST_MSG message. The throughput value MUST be calculated using the following formula:
{{{
THROUGHPUT_VALUE = 8 * SENT_BYTES / 1000 / TEST_TIME
}}}

The Server's TEST_MSG message looks as following: 

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/23.%20overall%20number%20of%20sent%20bytes%20%28encoded%20as%20string%20in%20float%20format%29%20in%20the%20TEST_MSG%20message.png

All these values MUST be separated by spaces.

Next, the Client MUST send to the Server its calculated throughput value encoded as string (float format) in the TEST_MSG message. The throughput value MUST be calculated using the following formula:
{{{
THROUGHPUT_VALUE = 8 * TRANSMITTED_BYTES / 1000 / TEST_TIME
}}}

The Client's TEST_MSG message looks as following: 

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/24.%20MUST%20send%20to%20the%20Server%20its%20calculated%20throughput%20value%20encoded%20as%20string%20%28float%20format%29%20in%20the%20TEST_MSG%20message.png

In the same time the Server SHOULD send its [NDTProtocol#Appendix_A._web100_variables web100 data variables] gathered during S2C throughput test to the Client. Each variable name/value pair should be encoded as strings in a separate TEST_MSG message using the following format:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/ndt_24b.png

where '\n' is a single new line character.

All available web100 data variables are described in [NDTProtocol#Appendix_A._web100_variables Appendix A]. The Server MUST send at least the following variables:
 # !AckPktsIn
 # CountRTT
 # !CongestionSignals
 # CurRTO
 # CurMSS
 # !DataBytesOut
 # !DupAcksIn
 # !MaxCwnd
 # !MaxRwinRcvd
 # !PktsOut
 # !PktsRetrans
 # !RcvWinScale
 # Sndbuf
 # !SndLimTimeCwnd
 # !SndLimTimeRwin
 # !SndLimTimeSender
 # !SndWinScale
 # SumRTT
 # Timeouts


At the end the Server MUST close the S2C test session by sending an empty TEST_FINALIZE message.

A S2C throughput test session overview can be seen on the following sequence diagram:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/25.%20A%20S2C%20throughput%20test%20session%20overview%20can%20be%20seen%20on%20the%20following%20sequence%20diagram.png

=== META test ===

The META test allows the Client to send an additional information to the Server to be included along with the overall set of test results. Information received from the Client is encoded as key/value pairs.

==== META protocol ====

All messages exchanged between the Client and the Server during the META protocol are sent using the same connection and message format as the NDTP-Control protocol.

The Server MUST start this test by sending an empty TEST_PREPARE message followed by an empty TEST_START message.

Next, the Client SHOULD send meta data encoded as strings in the TEST_MSG messages:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/26.%20Next,%20the%20Client%20SHOULD%20send%20meta%20data%20encoded%20as%20strings%20in%20the%20TEST_MSG%20messages.png

For example:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/27.%20For%20example.png

Both parts (keys and values) of the meta data MUST be strings with the following constraints:
 * Keys MUST be shorter than 64 characters
 * Values MUST be shorter than 256 characters

Although this protocol is generic enough to store any type of information (encoded as strings), it is RECOMMENDED to store at least the following data (the Server MUST properly recognize these keys):

|| *Key name* || *Description* ||
|| "client.os.name" || Operating system name in a short format (for example "Linux", "Windows NT", "Mac OS", etc.) ||
|| "client.browser.name" || Web browser name with a version number (for example "MSIE 7.0", "Firefox/3.6.18", etc.) ||
|| "client.kernel.version" || Operating system kernel version (for example "2.6.35-30-server") ||
|| "client.version" || NDT client version (for example "3.6.4") ||

The Client MUST finish uploading its meta data by sending an empty TEST_MSG message.

At the end the Server MUST close the META test session by sending an empty TEST_FINALIZE message.

A META test session overview can be seen on the following sequence diagram:

|| !SndLimTransRwin || The number of transitions into the 'Receiver Limited' state from either the 'Congestion Limited' or 'Sender Limited' states. This state is entered whenever TCP transmission stops because the sender has filled the announced receiver window. ||
|| !SndLimTransCwnd || The number of transitions into the 'Congestion Limited' state from either the 'Receiver Limited' or 'Sender Limited' states. This state is entered whenever TCP transmission stops because the sender has reached some limit defined by congestion control (e.g. cwnd) or other algorithms (retransmission timeouts) designed to control network traffic. ||
|| !SndLimTransSender || The number of transitions into the 'Sender Limited' state from either the 'Receiver Limited' or 'Congestion Limited' states. This state is entered whenever TCP transmission stops due to some sender limit such as running out of application data or other resources and the Karn algorithm. When TCP stops sending data for any reason which can not be classified as Receiver Limited or Congestion Limited it MUST be treated as Sender Limited. ||
|| !SndLimBytesRwin || The cumulative bytes sent while in the 'Receiver Limited' state, as determined by the Local Host, when the Local Host is a sender.  This state is entered whenever TCP transmission stops due to Receiver not being able to receive data. ||
