#summary Description of the data collected by NDT

=Data collected by the NDT= 

== Abstract == 

The Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) is a client/server program that provides network configuration and performance testing to a user's computer. The measured factors along with some additional analysis and detailed test traces are stored by the server for the future reuse. Moreover, multi-level results allow novice and expert users to view and understand the test results. This document describes what, where and when is stored by the NDT server. The information contained here should be enough to support parsing of the collected data for analysis and visualization purposes.

== Introduction ==

The NDT uses the following files to store the test results data:

|| *File* || *Scope of the collected data* || *Always used?* || *File extension* ||
|| *tcpdump trace* || C2S/S2C tests || *NO* (enabled by `-t, --tcpdump` options) || {{{*}}}.c2s_ndttrace / {{{*}}}.s2c_ndttrace ||
|| *web100 snaplog trace* || C2S/S2C tests || *NO* (enabled by `--snaplog` option) || {{{*}}}.c2s_snaplog / {{{*}}}.s2c_snaplog ||
|| *web100srv.log* || test session || YES || {{{*}}}.log ||
|| *cputime trace* || test session || *NO* (enabled by `--cputime` option) || {{{*}}}.cputime ||
|| *meta data file* || test session || YES || {{{*}}}.meta ||

The web100srv.log file is by default written under the `/usr/local/ndt/` directory. However, this can be changed by using the `-l, --log` options.

All other files are saved under the data directory (by default `/usr/local/ndt/serverdata/`) which can be set by using the `-L, --log_dir` options. To minimize the number of files in one directory, the test results are further grouped by the year, month and day the test was started in.

To sum up, the result files are saved in the following directories:

{{{
/DataDirPath/YYYY/MM/DD/
}}}

For example:

{{{
/usr/local/ndt/serverdata/2011/08/24/
}}}

The mentioned files (all except web100srv.log) are saved using the following filename format:

|| *ISOtime*{{{_}}}*serverFQDN*:*portNumber*.*extension* ||

where:
 * *ISOtime* - current time in the ISO format
 * *serverFQDN* - server host fully qualified name
 * *portNumber* - currently used port number (ephemeral ports for the snaplog and tcpdump traces, control session port for the cputime and meta files)
 * *extension* - extension used to distinguish file types

For example:

{{{
20110824T21:11:45.99598000Z_jeremian-laptop.local:33687.c2s_ndttrace
}}}

==Collected data formats==

===meta data file===

The meta data file is always created for every test session. If the particular test does not have a corresponding meta data file, it can be caused by the following issues:
 * the test was abruptly interrupted by some unexpected error
 * there was an error during file creation (for example lack of disk space)
 * the test was performed by the old NDT version, that did not write meta data files

The meta data file contains the names of the other files, the clients & servers IP addr and FQDN, and the encoded line of the web100/analysis data. The meta data contains lines in the following order:

|| *#* || *Name* || *Description/Comment* ||
|| 1. || Date/Time || Timestamp of the beginning of the test session ||
|| 2. || C2S [NDTDataFormat#web100_snaplog_trace snaplog] file || Filename of the snaplog taken during C2S Throughput test ||
|| 3. || C2S [NDTDataFormat#tcpdump_trace ndttrace] file || Filename of the tcpdump trace taken during C2S Throughput test ||
|| 4. || S2C [NDTDataFormat#web100_snaplog_trace snaplog] file || Filename of the snaplog taken during S2C Throughput test ||
|| 5. || S2C [NDTDataFormat#tcpdump_trace ndttrace] file || Filename of the tcpdump trace taken during S2C Throughput test ||
|| 6. || [NDTDataFormat#cputime_trace cputime] file || Filename of the cputime trace taken during the whole test session ||
|| 7. || server IP address || IP address of the NDT server ||
|| 8. || server hostname || Hostname of the NDT server ||
|| 9. || server kernel version || Kernel version of the NDT server's OS ||
|| 10. || client IP address || IP address of the NDT client ||
|| 11. || client hostname || Fully qualified hostname of the NDT client ||
|| 12. || client OS name || (*optional*) Name of the NDT client's OS ||
|| 13. || client browser name || (*optional*) Name of the NDT client's web browser (if applicable) ||
|| 14. || Summary data || A one-line summary of the test containing the final values of some of the web100 variables with an additional analysis details. The particular values are separated with commas without any spaces. The results are written with the same order and contain the same values as the one-line summary from the [NDTDataFormat#web100srv.log_file web100srv.log file] (except the date and client name) ||
|| 15. || Additional data || (*optional*) A multi-line information containing additional data sent by the client using the META protocol. Currently defined key/value pairs can be found in the [NDTProtocol#META_test NDT Protocol document] ||

The optional values from the meta data file are set during the [NDTProtocol#META_test META test]. This means that these values are empty when the client does not support the [NDTProtocol#META_test META test] or it does not send these values.

===tcpdump trace===

Writing tcpdump trace files is enabled by the `-t, --tcpdump` options.

These are a standard trace files for all packets (except the initial syn & syn/ack exchange) sent during the individual C2S/S2C subtests (only the throughput tests' traffic is gathered that is sent on a newly created connection, all the NDT control protocol communication is not captured in these dump files).

The packets from the C2S Throughput test are stored in the {{{*}}}.c2s_ndttrace file, the packets from the S2C Throughput test are stored in the {{{*}}}.s2c_ndttrace file.

These tcpdump files are written using the [http://www.tcpdump.org/ pcap] library.

The tcpdump files can be read using [http://www.tcpdump.org/ tcpdump] and [http://www.tcptrace.org/ tcptrace] programs.

===web100 snaplog trace===

Writing snaplog files is enabled by the `--snaplog` option.

These files contain all the [http://www.web100.org/ web100] kernel MIB variables' values written in a fixed time (default is 5 msec) increments for the individual C2S/S2C subtests (these snapshots are taken only for a newly created connection used for the throughput test).

The snapshots from the C2S Throughput test are stored in the {{{*}}}.c2s_snaplog file, the snaphots from the S2C Throughput test are stored in the {{{*}}}.s2c_snaplog file.

The snaplog files are a binary files written in the format defined by the [http://www.web100.org/ web100] library. In addition to the standard [http://www.web100.org/ web100] variables' values written in each snapshot, the 'Duration' variable is also stored to indicate the number of seconds from the beginning of the snaplog session.

The list of logged variables with a short description can be found in the [NDTProtocol#Appendix_A._web100_variables NDT Protocol document].

The NDT package comes with a utility (called genplot) that can convert snaplog trace files into text or xplot graph files. Alternatively the user can write their own analysis program using the [http://www.web100.org/ web100] library functions.

===web100srv.log file===

The NDT always writes a one-line summary of the test to the `web100srv.log` file. The `web100srv.log` file is a standard log file and may contain lines that aren't summary lines (e.g. if debugging is enabled, there's a ton of information logged to this file).

This one-line summary contains the final values of some of the web100 variables with an additional analysis details. The particular values are separated with commas without any spaces. The results are stored with the following order:

|| *#* || *Name* || *Description/Comment* ||
|| 1. || date || start time of the test session (in the form "Jun 30 21:49:08"). *Warning:* this field does not contain information about the year ||

(*{{{*}}}*) web100 variable. For a more detailed and up-to-date description please look at the current version of the [http://www.web100.org/download/kernel/tcp-kis.txt tcp-kis.txt] file.

===cputime trace===

Writing cputime file is enabled by `--cputime` option.

This file contains lines with `times` routine results recorded using a 100ms interval. Each of the lines contains the following data separated by a single space in this order:

|| *#* || *Name* || *Description/Comment* ||
|| 1. || time || seconds from the beginning of the test ||
|| 2. || user time || contains  the  CPU  time spent executing instructions of the calling process ||
|| 3. || system time || contains the CPU time spent in the system while executing tasks on behalf of the calling proces ||
|| 4. || user time of the children || contains the sum of the user time and user time of the children values for all waited-for terminated children ||
|| 5. || system time of the children || contains the sum of the system time and system time of the children values for all waited-for terminated children ||

All times reported are in clock ticks.

A clock tick is same as a cycle, the smallest unit of time recognized by a device. For personal computers, clock ticks generally refer to the main system clock. The number of clock ticks per second can be obtained using:
{{{
sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK);
}}}

==Displaying collected data==

The NDT server also contains a Java application that can look through the NDT log files and link log entries to trace files, and it also simplifies the viewing of this data.

The JAnalyze application can be started by running a single jar file:

{{{
$ java -jar JAnalyze.jar
}}}

The NDT web100srv.log file can be loaded by using `Load` option from the `File` menu.

You can see the JAnalyze application in action on the following screenshot:

http://www.soldevelo.com/images/ndt/janalyze.png

The utility will need to be rewritten slightly to take advantage of the meta files instead of (in addition to) the log files.
 
The detailed tcpdump and snaplog files can be used to re-examine the test to see what happened, i.e.:
  * was there packet loss during the s2c test, and if so when/how often did it occur? 
  * what was the maximum throughput during TCP's slow-start growth phase? 
  * how many times did TCP oscillate in the Congestion Avoidance phase? 
  * did the test compete with other traffic? 
  * was there non-congestive loss on the path? 
  * was the test limited by the user's PC (default tunable settings)? 
  * how often did TCP retransmit packets, and were any of these unnecessary? 
  * were packets being reordered (e.g., sent 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 but received 1, 2, 4, 3, 5) 
  * what was the capacity of the bottleneck link in this path? 
  * did the test produce the expected results? 
  * was the client connected to a wired or wireless (!WiFi) network? 
  * is there a firewall and/or NAT box in the path?
