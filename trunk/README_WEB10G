                            ndt-web10g

Required libraries:

Web10G
Download and install the latest userland and your kernel patch from 
http://web10g.org. You will need the use the Web10G userland-2.0.6.2
(as at time of writing the newest release).

This is known/expected to work with the following web10g kernel patches:
Web10G-0.6.2-patches (Linux kernel 3.6, 3.7 & 3.8).
Web10G-0.4-3.5-patch - You will have to make a small modification

IMPORTANT - Web10G-0.4-3.5-patch modification
Swap the single occurrence of ktime_to_ns(...) to ktime_to_us(...) 
before applying the patch.

This will not work with the 3.2 kernel patch or earlier. Try running
the sample applications included in the 2.0.6.2 userland, if these do 
not work the kernel patch your using doesn't support this userland 
and cannot be used.

Although you only need the library installed to build, the patched 
web10g kernel is required to run the server, reading a log file on the 
other hand should be ok with the kernel patch. REMEMBER to modprobe 
tcp_estats_nl first and you'll most likely need sudo permissions to run
the server.

I2Util
Grab the copy included in the ndt-3.6.5.1 release in the ndt google
code project page. https://ndt.googlecode.com/files/ndt-3.6.5.1.tar.gz
Or from svn here 
Build Instructions:

Should be as simple as 
./bootstrap
./configure
make

Web100 is still fully supported and if Web100 libs are found web100srv
will also be built.

Running:
Unlike web100srv, web10gsrv doesn't require the variable name file and
this will be ignored (-f option). Besides that the two work alike.

The client web100clt can be used with both the Web10G and Web100 
servers. Only very minor changes have been made - such that the
original ndt-web100 client should work correctly with both versions of
the server.

genplot is for web100 snaps where as genplot10g works with Web10G.
 
I've tested with Linux 3.5.1 kernel patched with web10g
Web10G-0.4-3.5-patch(modified) 
- There are some issues with logging Web10G Vars.

Linux 3.8.8 kernel with web10g web10g-0.6.2-3.8.patch.
- Works well.

Known issues:
Web10G related
* Web10g kernel patch not quite right - 3.5 kernel patch need to swap
  ktime_to_ns to ktime_to_us.
* Logging using the 3.5 kernel patch doesn't work perfectly. Timestamps
  and addresses are NOT recorded.
* Server, Client(C and Java Applet) and genplot have been ported.
  Other tools don't appear to rely upon the web100/10g library.

Other
* Running the server without a DNS server can cause tests to timeout and
  fail. Add the NI_NUMERICHOST flag into the getnameinfo call within 
  _I2AddrSetNodePort() in the I2Util library to fix.
* MSS incorrectly detecting modification when testing via IPv6??
* A general ndt problem 10Gig connections may overflow integer values
  and hence results may not be accurate - let us know if you notice
  this happening.
